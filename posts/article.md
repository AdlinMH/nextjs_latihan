# What is "An Article"?

An article is any member of a class of dedicated words that are used with noun phrases to mark the identifiability of the referents of the noun phrases. In English, both "the" and "a" are articles, which combine with a noun to form a noun phrase. Articles typically specify grammatical definiteness of the noun phrase, but in many languages they carry additional grammatical information such as gender, number, and case. Articles are part of a broader category called determiners, which also include demonstratives, possessive determiners, and quantifiers. In linguistic interlinear glossing, articles are abbreviated as art.
